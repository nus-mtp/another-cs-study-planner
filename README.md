## About the Project

CSModify is a web application that displays data visualizations and simulate module changes, to assist in module planning for NUS School of Computing (SoC).

Module planning is a process where module administrators make various decisions for modules. Some examples would be deciding which modules should be mounted/dismounted for a particular Academic Year-Semester (denoted as an AY-Sem), determining the quota that should be allocated to a module, or finding out how many students will be affected should a module be taken down in a particular AY-Sem.

Module planning itself is, by no means, an easy feat. As there is no central system for doing this currently, what this project aims to do would be to assist module planners by showing data visualizations of their queries in a manner that is easy to process. By doing so, we hope that they will be able to make decisions regarding module planning with greater convenience and ease.
